# Problems and Future Solutions
I had originally planned to use raycasting along with shaders to give the appearance of echolocation. After spending many hours trying to get this to work I gave up on it and decided to use a different method. Instead, I created an object that would be carriable and throwable that would produce colored light. When emitted onto the dark gray environment, it gives the illusion of being able to see. I had then planned to add a flicker effect onto the orb once it collides with the environment but this also proved to be tricky and was left not done. 
The project ends up being more of a proof of concept rather than an actual game. I think I have a base that can be used in either some sort of 3D puzzle platformer or maybe even some sort of horror game.
